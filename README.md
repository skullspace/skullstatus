# Skullstatus

Skullstatus is the Skullspace Status Server and client applications.
There will be a large switch by the door in skullspace, and each branch
in this repository will be a different client application you can use to
monitor the status of this switch. The idea is that people flip the
switch when they come in, and everyone is notified so that they can come
join the party.

Currently there is no switch, the status server is hardcoded to "Yes",
and there is only an OS X client application. Baby steps.
